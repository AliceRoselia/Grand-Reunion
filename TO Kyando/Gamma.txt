Hi, Kyando. Nice to meet you again, fellow bearer of existential crisis.

I am happy to announce that HOJ has gotten bigger since last time.

I know you're having an existential crisis,
in which case, you are lucky, for others never had any.
They will never have plans for their lives.

I know well how your ideology think. They are right...
And they are dead wrong. Some say I should not be talking
such a thing to a talk about depression, but it is ALL related.

There are poor workers... everywhere. There are people suffering.
And no matter what, there will be selfish people. 
But... socialism is wrong and depressing, for it believes that 
no individual can do anything or initiate anything.
Unlike them, I believe in the potential of individual humans.
I've gone far. I have explored many kinds.
No matter what you believe in, if you help someone based on your beliefs,
you are a good person. Starting a cooperative union or a business is okay.

Now, we welcome you. And there will be more coming too.
More messages are coming your way. Don't worry.
LOVE YOU!
