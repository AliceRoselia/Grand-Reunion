Hello!

Finally done with DataStructures.jl! Starting Arceus, an ECS based on magic bitboard!

Then, a search framework.

Lots of things in the future.
Yeah... it's gonna be a bit slow here since I'm likely being stress-tested in real life as well. What doesn't break you makes you stronger right?

Love.
Bye.
