Dear Ann. 

Whatever you are called, no matter what name you use, no matter where you are, and no matter what form you take, you know that if you call my name, I will hear your voice.
Good intention does not mean good result. Love does not solve anything alone. I may not share your ideology, but I share your wish. 

The world is broken, just maybe not in the way you think. We need different minds. Just believe it. 
You do not need a large crowd to have a large impact. You have no limit. Believe in yourself.

If you want to join us, we Custodian of funs are waiting.

Love.
