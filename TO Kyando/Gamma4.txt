Happy pride month!
Let's put aside our differences to get things done.  
We're glad you were here. 


To clarify my economic ideology.
Currencies are something which are valued by people
and people collect them to trade with others.
In the human history, there are many currencies, 
some explicit, some implicit. 
Gold, for example, was used as a currency before. 
Reputation could also implicitly be a currency

Currently, dollars/etc are the main currencies. 
And they're bottlenecks. 
Poor people getting fed is a value, but nobody
accept this value as a currency. 
If you let everyone print their own currencies, 
that would be the best. 
People have value, but no reach to currency. 
We need to solve this currency bottleneck. 

You own your body, and by extension, its products. 
You're free to trade in whatever system you believe in, 
using any currency, explicit or implicit, with whatever 
management policy. 

For me, whether you make a business or a team, 
it doesn't matter. If you believe it is helping,
I love you. 

I am a permissivist.

Please welcome me back!
We're in this together!

Nah? Fine. 

If the shifting tide of destiny bring us together 
once again, we shall meet. 

Love. 

Gamma.
